            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere is but one way of coming into the World, but many passages out; nothing is so sure as Death, and nothing so uncertain as the time. We may be two old to Live, but can never be too young to Die; for who knows when Death will Summon him, whether in Youth, in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or in Old Age; we have frequent Examples of all; or who knows whether God will take away his Life by a long Death-bed Sickness; whether thou mayst Die by the Sword, or by any sudden Casualty; of all which we have daily Examples in our Weckly Bills of Mortality, and this present Story Relates a Remarkable one, of one supposed by some Papers found about him,

            <p>Squire <hi>Fawcett</hi> and some other Gentlemen being a Hunting the day aforesaid, the Dogs running into a wood in the Parish of <hi>Finchley,</hi> near <hi>Highgate,</hi> in their Scent found the Body of the aforesaid Mr. <hi>Higgens,</hi> and made some stop, upon which the Gentlemen coming up saw the said Body lying on one side, and was so putrified they were fain to get the weather side: His Eyes were both Eaten or pocked out, but that which was most remarkable, the inside was eaten with Vermin, and the Skin in a manner whole; he had on a Black <hi>French Hat,</hi> and a Mourning Hat-band, with a white Cloth bound about his Head; he had also a Black Suit almost New, but that part which was downward Rotted away, by the dampness of the Earth: He had a pair of Fring'd Gloves, a new pair of Shoes, with steel Buckles, a Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boon Cane with a Silver Head. The Gentlemen leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off their Game, orders were given for his removal to one Mr. <hi>Ralph Bradshaw</hi>'s Barn, after which he was Cried in those parts, but no Relation could be given of him; then the Masters of the Parish sent for Mr. <hi>Hari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> the Coroner, who issued out his Warrant to impan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel a Jury, which done, they sat upon the said Body at Mr. <hi>Bradshaw</hi>'s House, formerly the <hi>Kings-Arms</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Highgate;</hi> his Shirt was marked with <hi>F.
